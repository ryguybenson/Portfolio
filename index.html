          <p><img class="epicodus" src="images/epicodus.png" alt="A picture of the epicodus logo">After high school I was unsure what career I wanted to pursue so I enrolled at Clark Community College. My plan was to get my AA (associates of arts degree) then transfer to a four year college. However, after my first year at Clark I decided conventional schooling wasn't whay I wanted to so I decided to take some time away from school to explore other options. I became interested in coding and programming and planned to go back to Clark to take some coding classes but they required that I take some math and english classes before I could sign up for coding classes. I alredy knew I didn't want to take classes I had no interest in so that's when I researching vocational schools. After a few months I ran into an old friend who had graduated from Epicodus and he highly reccomended I consider it. After that I looked into Epicodus further and decided it was exactly what I was looking for.
